# MedicalAnalyser

<H1>Exercise 16</H1> 

Download the C# project MedicalAnalyser from the class website. 
This project contains a class called BodyAnalyser, with a completed method CalculateBMI, plus an unfinished method AnalyseBMI. BMI stands for “Body Mass Index” (Google it ). The unfinished method does compile, but it is not implemented correctly! 
Your job is to correctly implement the method AnalyseBMI. The specification is as follows: 
<ul>
 <li/>If the BMI is less than 15, it must return “You are way too skinny!”
 <li/>If the BMI is between 15 and 22, it must return “You are a bit skinny”
 <li/>If the BMI is between 22 and 28, it must return “You are just fine!”
 <li/>If the BMI is between 28 and 35, it must return “You are a bit overweight!”
 <li/>If the BMI is more than 35, it must return “You are way too fat!”
</ul>
As always, remember to write some code that tests your work.
