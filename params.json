BMI stands for “Body Mass Index” (Google it ). The unfinished method does compile, but it is not implemented correctly! \r\nYour job is to correctly implement the method AnalyseBMI. The specification is as follows: \r\n<ul>\r\n <li/>If the BMI is less than 15, it must return “You are way too skinny!”\r\n <li/>If the BMI is between 15 and 22, it must return “You are a bit skinny”\r\n <li/>If the BMI is between 22 and 28, it must return “You are just fine!”\r\n <li/>If the BMI is between 28 and 35, it must return “You are a bit overweight!”\r\n <li/>If the BMI is more than 35, it must return “You are way too fat!”\r\n</ul>\r\nAs always, remember to write some code that tests your work.\r\n",
